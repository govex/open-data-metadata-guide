# Categories

As an open data portal grows beyond 25 to 30 datasets, organizing content by subject or theme becomes increasingly important for usability. Short, concise categories—typically no more than a word or two—help visitors browse and discover data more intuitively. Grouping related datasets in this way enables users to explore available information for inspiration, rather than relying solely on search functions to find something specific.

Establishing clear categories is a foundational step in launching an open data portal. These categories don’t need to be permanent. For smaller portals, starting with three or four categories is sufficient, with regular reviews—such as annually—as new datasets are added. Mature portals typically maintain between 8 and 12 well-defined categories. Having too many can lead to overly narrow groupings, while too few can make navigation difficult and reduce the usefulness of each category.

There is no universal standard for category names across open data portals, but many use similar themes. Common examples include:

* Business
* Education
* Environment
* Finance
* Health
* Human or Social Services
* Property
* Public Safety
* Recreation
* Transportation

Consulting a librarian or information architect can be especially helpful when developing or revising your category structure. Their expertise can ensure the taxonomy supports both clarity and discoverability, making the portal more effective and user-friendly.
