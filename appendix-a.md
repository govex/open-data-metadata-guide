# Appendix: Sample Dataset Metadata

## Standard Dataset Fields

The U.S. federal government has created the Project Open Data metadata schema standard to implement the federal open data policy. The [Project Open Data schema](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/) is based on the international DCAT metadata schema used by open data programs around the world and [has been mapped to many standards](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/metadata-resources#field-mappings). The Project Open Data schema must be preseneted as a JSON file to be ingested by Data.gov. This schema is natively available with many open data portal providers including: _Azavea_, _Esri Open Data_, _NuCivic's DKAN_, _OpenGov_, and _Socrata_, and is easily added to _CKAN_ sites with an extension or can be generated on an ad hoc basis with these [tools](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/#tools).

## Federal Dataset Fields

The U.S. federal requirement also requires the following metadata fields. You should consider requiring local department codes, systems of record, and associated IT spending if helpful for your open data catalog. If you do not have unique governmentwide codes related to these areas, you might consider creating those.
